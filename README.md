Book Club - my book collection application that brings together my love of reading with a digital experience.

This project marks my first time connecting a React frontend with an Express backend, creating a full-stack environment that is functional.

This application allows you to

Browse a personal library of books

Filter by categories

View detailed information about each book

Add new books with cover images

Edit and remove entries



**Running the Project**

Backend Setup

cd assignment-2/api

npm install

npm run dev

Frontend Setup

cd assignment-2/web

npm install

npm start

The application connects to a MySQL database that stores both the book information and relationships between books and categories.

**What I Learned**

First time working with back end. Only have done front end projects. So I'm happy to add a new skill that I can use for future work. 
This time, I had a reference from labs so i'll brush up on my backend work so I can be a 'half-stack developer'? I dont know, it's a different language completely and has a learning curve.

**Moving Forward**

User authentication to create personal reading lists

Reading progress tracking

Connection to external book APIs

Recommendations based on reading patterns
